netsync treats the asset management database as a prescripition for what it finds on the network in a sort of de jure/de facto relationship, respectively.

every once in a while (esp. around large network changes or new hardware), check the node log for entries that say no devices found. these are devices that are active, but do not have any of the oids that netsync checks. this is a simple fix in most cases.


running a level 2 probe in quiet mode (or say you dont want to resolve when it asks) causes unrecognized interfaces to be included in the dump. it also causes duplicates to be resolved by taking the latest one seen. unrecognized devices are also included in the csv. later entries in a database are considered to have been added later chronologically


To remove all extraneous entries in the database, import Probe2Cache (var/db.csv) into the database after running netsync -p2 with either -D (for DNS) or an RFC1035-compliant list of the nodes you wish to include.

netsync should be run at the following times:

-after adding a node to dns
-after attaching a new node to the network
-after adding a new device to an existing stack (or creating a stack by adding a second device)
